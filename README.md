# Restaurant Fed Up

![Alt text] (<img\LogoMakr-9P9oJ7.jpg>)

In this assignement we have to get 3 blogs from a restarurant wordpress CMS. 

## Description

1. Create a WordPress website on your web host for ‘Fed Up’. You don’t need to style or edit 
the website, all you need to use is the WordPress REST API.
2. Write at least 3 blog posts on the WordPress admin page. You can use 
http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/ for the content of the blog posts.
3. Create an HTML and JavaScript file separate to your WordPress site
4. Make a call to the WordPress REST API that you have installed on your web host
5. Display the blog posts on your HTML page. The styling of the page is not important, but the 
data should pull through correctly from the API and each blog post should be displayed.
6. Upload the HTML and JavaScript files to your web host and submit a link to the blog posts.

## Acknowledgments

I am greatfull for the help given from the teachers in Noroff to get to understand and progress on my studies and getting the tools to be able to make this project. Also to the fellow students, for the chats and encouraging words, those are precious in times of stress and frustration. Also to my family that has shown me patients in my journey to get another career, giving me the space needed to study and work.
